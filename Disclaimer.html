            This marker was generated by ChatGPT. I create as many markers as possible myself. However, it takes a lot of time to create these markers, time that I could spend improving the site. I will create as many markers as possible, but to achieve a sufficient number of markers to make this site worthwhile, I have to resort to ChatGPT and third-party information. I do vet this information to ensure that it has no glaring errors. However, the following flaws are likely to occur from time to time:<br>slight inaccuracies, especially in numbers, and
            slight errors in the location of the markers, however, these should only amount to a few meters
