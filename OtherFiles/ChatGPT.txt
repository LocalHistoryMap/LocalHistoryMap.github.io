I am making a website where people can explore a map with markers that show some local history.

Give me some interesting and obscure historical stories from Dublin. Format them the following way:

{
        "Disc": "Generated by ChatGPT"
        "Title": "Title",
        "Cords": Coordinates,
        "Text": "Text"
}

Fill in only the Title Coordinates and Text.  The "Disc" has to always be "Generated by ChatGPT"The Title should be a good title for the story and only a few words. 
Cords should be coordinates of the marker this should be someplace that is associated with the story, format them as following:

put only the numbers, begin with the value for north then put a comma and then the value for West

the text should be a short text that explains what the Story is about, 4-5 sentences, it should only explain the story, do not put any advice for travelers, only write about the event in a factual and formal tone do not address the reader at all

Here is an example of this data filled out correctly:

{
        "Disc": "Generated by ChatGPT"
        "Title": "Special Operations Executive",
        "Cords": [51.522710, -0.157400],
        "Text": "During World War II the Special Operations Executive (SOE) was based at 64 Baker Street, hence its nickname, the Baker Street Irregulars."

ALWAYS format your output in a code block that is made for json files, don't forget the commas between the curly brackets
